\section{Summary}
The paper explores the use of Neural Architecture Search (AutoNAC) to optimize YOLO-NAS for latency and throughput, resulting in three architectures (YOLO-NASS, YOLO-NASM, and YOLO-NASL). Fine-tuning on a custom dataset is performed, and the model's performance is evaluated on the RoboFlow100 dataset using metrics like IoU, Average Precision, mAP, Precision, Recall, and F1 Score. YOLO-NAS is found to be efficient, adaptable to diverse tasks and hardware, accurate in detection, and well-suited for applications like traffic management, security, and autonomous vehicles.
In conclusion, the study presents a comprehensive exploration of deep learning, object detection algorithms, and the YOLO-NAS model's application in real-time object recognition for autonomous vehicles, if we have reasonable dataset.
