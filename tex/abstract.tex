This thesis endeavors to investigate a deep learning-based obstacle avoidance system designed for autonomous vehicles, including mobile robots, through the utilization of Neural Architecture Search (NAS). In navigating complex environments, autonomous vehicles rely on sophisticated computer vision methodologies to promptly identify obstacles. The study provides a comprehensive evaluation of the efficacy of YOLO-NAS and its variants, underscoring their optimized performance in striking a desirable balance between precision and processing speed when employing identical hyperparameters. This effectiveness surpasses that of other manually crafted models in terms of operational efficiency. Moreover, the thesis accentuates the versatility of YOLO-NAS across various tasks and hardware configurations, positioning it as a valuable asset across a broad spectrum of applications. Through strategic pre-training, YOLO-NAS is endowed with a profound understanding, augmenting its proficiency in real-time object detection tasks.
