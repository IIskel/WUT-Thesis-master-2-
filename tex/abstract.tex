The study aims to develop a deep learning-based obstacle avoidance system for mobile robots using Neural Architecture Search (NAS) in Python. By leveraging advanced computer vision techniques, the goal is to equip mobile robots with the ability to perceive their environment, detect obstacles in real-time, and navigate safely through complex surroundings. The paper gives a balanced assessment of the performance of YOLO-NAS, highlighting its optimized efficiency in achieving an optimal balance between accuracy and speed, thus surpassing other human-designed models in terms of efficiency. Additionally, it emphasizes the adaptability of YOLO-NAS to diverse tasks and hardware, positioning it as a valuable tool across a spectrum of applications. The strategic pre-training of YOLO-NAS equips the model with a comprehensive understanding, enhancing its capabilities for real-time object detection applications.
