This study aims to create a deep learning-based obstacle avoidance system for mobile robots utilizing Neural Architecture Search (NAS) in Python. The goal is to equip mobile robots with the ability to perceive their environment, identify obstacles in real-time, and navigate safely through intricate surroundings in real-time.
